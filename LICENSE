VECTRI OPEN-SOURCE LICENSE

VECTRI is a open-source model released under an open-source license. 

It is free to use and modify for non-commercial, scientific and educational 
purposes, but is not "freeware" and may not be distributed to third parties, 
in either original or modified form. Instead we kindly ask you to direct 
colleagues to ICTP's VECTRI pages so we can keep a  record of who is using the 
code. 

If you make modifications to the code which you think will benefit the user 
community, we encourage you to create a branch and submit a merge request, so 
all can benefit from your changes.

VECTRI is released with the disclaimer that the model is a research tool 
and comes with no support or guarentees and the authors and ICTP bear no legal 
responsibility whatsoever for any loss, financial or otherwise, that may 
occur through its use.

All that the authors ask is that:

1. You state the origin of the model in any work you publicize.
2. You reference the Tompkins and Ermert 2013 manuscript in any article that 
   ses the model, even in a modified form.
3. That a copy of any article using the model is sent to the authors after 
   (or preferably before) submission to add to the database here.
4. If you are thinking to use the model in an international grant proposal 
   that you consider inviting ICTP to collaborate if the grant conditions allow 
   (VECTRI development speed relies on external funding opportunities).
5. You have no objections to your institute being listed on the above maps of 
    VECTRI users. 

These simple requests are to justify to the funding agencies that support the 
ICTP institution and the EU that supports much of the project research that the 
model development is useful to the wider community.
